# CS 4374 Intro to Machine Learning
Repository for Introduction to Machine Learning at UTD

## Machine Learning Portfolio
This is a description of machine learning in my own terms.  
[Here is a link to the document](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Portfolio.pdf)

## C++ Exploration
In this program, we programmed various built-in functions from R in C++ from scratch, and compared the difficulty of hard coding and having it built-in.  
[Here is the output](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Data%20Exploration.pdf)  
[Here is the code](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/DataExploration.cpp)  


## Linear Models Portfolio
In this Assignment, I:  
-Performed data cleaning and data exploration on medium-sized data sets  
-Performed machine learning using linear models  
-Evaluated model performance  
The Linear Regression portion can be found [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Regression.pdf)  
The Classification portion can be found [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Classification.pdf)  

## Machine Learning from Scratch
Logistic Regression [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/LogisticRegression.cpp)  
Naive Bayes [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Naive_Bayes.cpp) with header file [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Naive_Bayes.h)  
Explanation in pdf [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/ML%20Algorithms%20From%20Scratch.pdf)


## Searching for Similarity  
In this section we gained experience with machine learning using similarity models kNN and Decision Trees.  
I used linear regression, kNN, and Decision Trees and compared their outputs to each other.  
The pdf output for that is [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Regression2%201.pdf)  
The writeup explaining how they work can be found [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Searching%20for%20Similarity.pdf)  

  
  ## Kernel and Ensemble
  For Regression, my R Notebook is [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Notebook1Regression.Rmd) and the pdf of output is [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Notebook1Regression%201.pdf)  
  For Classification, my notebook is [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Notebook2Classification.Rmd) and the pdf output is [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Notebook2Classification.pdf)
  For the Ensemble techniques, my R notebook was done with a partner and can be found [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Ensemble_techniques.Rmd) the pdf output is [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/6-Ensemble_techniques.pdf) and his narrative covering the techniques can be found [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/narrative.pdf)  
  
  ## ML with sklearn
  In this assignment, we gained experience with machine learning in sklearn on a small data set. This is first time using sklearn and I was able to get a good grasps on the difference between sklearn and R.  
  You can see what I did [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/ML%20with%20sklearn.ipynb%20-%20Colaboratory.pdf)  
    
  ## Image Classification  
  I used python and familiarized myself with Keras and image classification.
  I took a dataset with 5 different sets of images of flowers (about 1270 each) and created an program that classified the type of flowers.
  You can see what I did [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/ImageClassification.ipynb%20-%20Colaboratory.pdf)
