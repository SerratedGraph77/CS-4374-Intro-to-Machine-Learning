# CS 4374 Intro to Machine Learning
Repository for Introduction to Machine Learning at UTD

## Machine Learning Portfolio
This is a description of machine learning in my own terms.  
[Here is a link to the document](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Portfolio.pdf)

## C++ Exploration
In this program, we programmed various built-in functions from R in C++ from scratch, and compared the difficulty of hard coding and having it built-in.  
[Here is the output](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Data%20Exploration.pdf)  
[Here is the code](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/DataExploration.cpp)  


## Linear Models Portfolio
In this Assignment, I:  
-Performed data cleaning and data exploration on medium-sized data sets  
-Performed machine learning using linear models  
-Evaluated model performance  
The Linear Regression portion can be found [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Regression.pdf)  
The Classification portion can be found [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Classification.pdf)  

## Machine Learning from Scratch
Logistic Regression [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/LogisticRegression.cpp)  
Naive Bayes [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Naive_Bayes.cpp) with header file [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Naive_Bayes.h)  
Explanation in pdf [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/ML%20Algorithms%20From%20Scratch.pdf)


## Searching for Similarity  
In this section we gained experience with machine learning using similarity models kNN and Decision Trees.  
I used linear regression, kNN, and Decision Trees and compared their outputs to each other.  
The pdf output for that is [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Regression2%201.pdf)
The writeup explaining how they work can be found [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Searching%20for%20Similarity.pdf)
