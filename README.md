# CS 4374 Intro to Machine Learning
Repository for Introduction to Machine Learning at UTD

## Machine Learning Portfolio
This is a description of machine learning in my own terms.

## C++ Exploration
In this program, we programmed various built-in functions from R in C++ from scratch, and compared the difficulty of hard coding and having it built-in.  
[Here is the output](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Data%20Exploration.pdf)

## Linear Models Portfolio
In this Assignment, I:  
-Performed data cleaning and data exploration on medium-sized data sets  
-Performed machine learning using linear models  
-Evaluated model performance  
The Linear Regression portion can be found [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Regression.pdf)  
The Classification portion can be found [here](https://github.com/SerratedGraph77/CS-4374-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Classification.pdf)
